# Focus buddy!

This tiny application is meant to help with scheduling "Deep Work" blocks for focus time. At the start of each day create your initial set of focus blocks and then adjust them as needed throughout the day. Planning out beforehand what you will work on minimizes distraction and promotes focused work!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
